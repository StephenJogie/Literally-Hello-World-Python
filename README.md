# Literally-Hello-World-Python V0.1.0
Not much to say here. Just Hello World in Python 3.7.

# Version 0.1.1 of literally just Hello World in Python 3.7
# Additions in 0.1.1:
     1. stringManipulationForFunIGuess(input) function was added (need to import random for the fun)
       -Makes a copy of an input string and randomly capitalizes characters
       -Prints the original and then the new version to console. Pretty cool I guess
# Additions in 0.1.2:
     2. replace all camelCase with snake_case because that's what the PEP-8 style guide says
